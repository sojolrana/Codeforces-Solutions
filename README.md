## Codeforces Solutions Categorized by Algorithm and Data Structure

This repository contains my solutions to various **Codeforces** problems, organized by the algorithm or data structure used in solving them. The goal is to make it easier for others to find solutions based on specific problem-solving techniques.

### 📂 **Directory Structure**
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different algorithm or data structure, such as Prefix Sum, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy Algorithms. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution files with the problem number, a brief explanation of the approach, and the solution code.

```

### 📝 **How to Use This Repository**

- **Problem Categories**: Navigate through the directories to find problems grouped by the techniques or algorithms used to solve them.
- **Problem Solutions**: Each `.cpp` file is a C++ solution to a Codeforces problem. The solutions include:
  - The problem link.
  - A description of the approach used.
  - The solution code.

Example format of a solution file:

```cpp
// Problem: Codeforces 1234A (Link to the problem)
// Approach: Used Prefix Sum to efficiently compute subarray sums.
// Time complexity: O(n), Space complexity: O(n)

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

void solve(){
    // Solution code goes here
}

int main() {
    
}
```

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sojolrana/Codeforces-Solutions.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "Codeforces-Solutions/Prefix Sum"
   ```

3. **Compile and run the program**:
   ```bash
   g++ "1807 - D. Odd Queries.cpp" -o odd_queries ./odd_queries
   ```

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (such as `g++`).
